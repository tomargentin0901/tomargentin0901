[**LucilleJams**](https://github.com/tomargentin0901/LucilleJams) is a music recommendation system designed to deliver a highly personalized music experience. 
> **Key Features**  
> - **Personalized Recommendations:** Suggests music that resonates with user preferences, ensuring a customized listening experience.  
> - **Taste Visualization:** Maps users' musical interests in a 2D space, allowing them to explore and understand their tastes within a broader musical landscape.  
> - **Instant Previews:** Enables direct song previews, so users can sample and discover new tracks on the spot.

I developed LucilleJams from the ground up, starting with dataset selection, building the recommendation engine, and implementing a user-friendly front-end interface. The project not only enhances music discovery but also offers users a unique way to visualize and engage with their favorite tunes.
